## Type-safe request client

Before we dig deeper into the usage of Tuyau's request client, let's look at the problem we are trying to solve here.

### ü§¶ Problem - Headache of keeping frontend types in sync with the backend

Imagine you have built an AdonisJS API that you want to consume within your front-end application, which is written in React, Vue, or any other framework of your choice. 

Typically, you would create helper functions or classes that issue a `fetch` request to the API, and elsewhere within your application, you will interact with these helpers. For example:

```ts
export class MyAPI {
  async getPosts(options) {
    return fetch(
      `/posts?page=${options.page}&limit=${options.limit}`
    )
  }

  async getPost(id: number) {
    return fetch(`/posts/${id}`)
  }
}
```

While creating these helpers will keep your front-end code DRY by encapsulating all API calls in a single place. They are still far from offering a great development experience. For example:

- **There is no type safety**. You don't know what you're sending or receiving.
- **A lot of boilerplate code** to write for each API route. Here, we have just two routes, but it becomes tedious and repetitive if you have 10, 20, or 50.

You can get around the issue of type-safety by creating interfaces for the data you send and receive. However, it will still be a manual process and you will have to make sure that your backend API and front-end types are always in sync.

```ts
interface Post {
  id: number
  title: string
}

interface GetPostsOptions {
  page?: number
  limit?: number
}

export class MyAPI {
  async getPosts(options: GetPostsOptions): Promise<Post[]> {
    return fetch(
      `/posts?page=${options.page}&limit=${options.limit}`
    )
  }

  async getPost(id: number): Promise<Post> {
    return fetch(`/posts/${id}`)
  }
}
```

### ‚úÖ Solution: Auto generated type-safe request client

Tuyau offers an automatically generated front-end client from your AdonisJS API that is 100% typesafe without the need to maintain any types or runtime code yourself. Tuyau uses code generation to detect input and output types for your routes. Let‚Äôs take the same API example, now using Tuyau:

```ts
// In your front-end
import { createTuyau } from '@tuyau/client'
import { api } from '@your-monorepo/my-adonisjs-app/.adonisjs/api'

export const tuyau = createTuyau({
  api,
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3333',
})

const posts = tuyau.posts.$get({ page: 1, limit: 10 })
const post = tuyau.posts({ id: 1 }).$get()
```

**Everything in this example is fully typesafe**: Route parameters (like `/posts/:id`), payloads, query params, and responses and errors. TypeScript prevents many errors: missing payload properties, forgotten request parameters, or typos in response data. TypeScript will scream at you, and your code won‚Äôt compile until you fix the errors.

This also means you can use `tsc` in your CI pipeline to verify that your front end remains in sync with your backend. In short, Tuyau saves you time and reduces errors.

If you‚Äôre familiar with [tRPC](https://trpc.io/), [Elysia Eden](https://elysiajs.com/eden/overview), or [Hono RPC](https://hono.dev/docs/guides/rpc), it‚Äôs the same concept.

The Tuyau client works with any stack, including React, React Native, Vue, and Node.js. However, for it to function, you will need a monorepo setup.

## Installation

To get started, install Tuyau in your AdonisJS API:

```bash
node ace add @tuyau/core
```

Then, install the client in your frontend:

```bash
npm install @tuyau/client
```

Now, you‚Äôll need to generate the types. The `@tuyau/core` package exposes a command, `node ace tuyau:generate`, which will create a `.adonisjs/api.ts` file at the root of your AdonisJS project. This file contains all the types necessary for the client to function. This command does **not** run automatically at the moment. You will need to run it manually after certain changes in your AdonisJS project, such as:

- Adding a new route/controller to your project
- Adding a `request.validateUsing` call in your controller method

Other than that, you won‚Äôt need to run this command frequently. For example, if you update the controller method's return type or the Vine schema, you **don‚Äôt need** to run the command again.

Once done, you can import and configure the client in your front-end as follows:

```ts
/// <reference path="../../adonisrc.ts" />

import { createTuyau } from '@tuyau/client'
import { api } from '@your-monorepo/server/.adonisjs/api'

export const tuyau = createTuyau({
  api,
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3333',
})
```

You‚Äôll need to configure your monorepo so that your front end depends on your backend when importing the `.adonisjs/api.ts` file. More information [here](https://tuyau.julr.dev/docs/installation#sharing-the-api-definition).

And that‚Äôs it! You‚Äôre ready to use Tuyau on your front end!

## Cool Features

Tuyau comes with a lot of cool features to make your life easier. Here are some of them:

### Making Requests

Of course, making requests is Tuyau's primary goal. Here's a quick peek at multiple request methods:

```ts
// GET /users
await tuyau.users.$get()

// POST /users { name: 'John Doe' }
await tuyau.users.$post({ name: 'John Doe' })

// PUT /users/1 { name: 'John Doe' }
await tuyau.users({ id: 1 }).$put({ name: 'John Doe' })

// GET /users/1/posts?limit=10&page=1
await tuyau.users.$get({ query: { page: 1, limit: 10 } })
```

### Typesafe Links for Inertia Apps

If you‚Äôre using Inertia.js, Tuyau provides a helper to generate typesafe links. This way, you can avoid typos in your routes and parameters. Here‚Äôs how you can use it:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Link } from '@tuyau/inertia/vue'
</script>

<template>
  <Link route="users.posts.show" :params="{ id: 1, postId: 2 }">Go to post</Link>
</template>
```

This is also available for React.

### Ziggy-like Helpers

If you‚Äôve used Laravel and Inertia, you‚Äôre likely familiar with Ziggy, which allows you to reference route names on your front end instead of explicitly writing URLs. Tuyau offers similar functionality. Here‚Äôs an example:

```ts
/**
 * Backend
 */
router.get('/posts/:id/generate-invitation', '...').as('posts.generateInvitation')

/**
 * Client-side
 * Making a request using the route name
 */
await tuyau
  .$route('posts.generateInvitation', { id: 1 })
  .$get({ query: { limit: 10, page: 1 } })

/**
 * Generating the URL using the route name
 */
// http://localhost:3333/users/1/posts/2
const url = tuyau.$url('users.posts', { id: 1, postId: 2 })

// http://localhost:3333/venues/1/events/2
const url = tuyau.$url('venues.events.show', [1, 2])

// http://localhost:3333/users?page=1&limit=10
const url = tuyau.$url('users', { query: { page: 1, limit: 10 } })
```

### Typed Error Handling

Consider the following code:

```ts
/**
 * Backend
 */
class MyController {
  public async login({ request, response }) {
    const { email, password } = request.validateUsing(schema)
    if (password !== 'password') {
      return response.unauthorized({ message: 'Invalid credentials' })
    }

    return { token: 'secret-token' }
  }
}

router.post('/login', [MyController, 'login'])
```

A simple route that either returns a token or a 401 error with a `message` property.

Now, let‚Äôs call this route from our frontend with Tuyau:

```ts
const { data, error } = await tuyau
  .login
  .$post({ email: 'foo', password: 'password' })

/**
 * We have a union type between the data and the error, as 
 * we haven't yet narrowed down the type of the response.
 */
data
// ^? { token: string } | null

/**
 * Let's narrow down the type. If the error status is 401,
 * we know the error will have a message property.
 */
if (error) {
  if (error?.status === 401) {
    console.log(error.message)
    //            ^? string
  }
  return
}

/**
 * Now, we're sure the data is not null since
 * we checked for the error above.
 */
console.log(data.token)
//          ^? { token: string }
```

As you can see, Tuyau provides a clean and typesafe way to handle errors. However, if you handle errors through middleware, Tuyau cannot detect them. 

### Unwrapping the Response

As the previous example shows, you need to ‚Äúnarrow down‚Äù the response type to access its properties. Tuyau provides an `unwrap` function if you don‚Äôt need custom error handling and just want to access the data:

```ts
const data = await tuyau
  .login
  .$post({ email: 'foo', password: 'password' })
  .unwrap()

console.log(data.token)
```

If the API call returns an error, `unwrap` will throw an exception.

### Inferring Request and Response Types

If you need to infer the input and output types of a route, you can do it like this:

```ts
import type { 
  InferResponseType, 
  InferErrorType, 
  InferRequestType 
} from '@tuyau/client';

// InferRequestType
type LoginRequest = InferRequestType<typeof tuyau.login.post>;

// InferResponseType
type LoginResponse = InferResponseType<typeof tuyau.login.post>;

// InferErrorType
type LoginError = InferErrorType<typeof tuyau.login.post>;
```
