summary: AdonisJS just turned 10 years old. A decade of building, learning, and growing with a community that truly loves the framework
---

AdonisJS has just completed **10 years**. A full decade of writing code, fixing bugs, rewriting parts of the framework, and slowly shaping it into something developers can trust and enjoy using.

When I first started this project, I didn't have a master plan. I wanted to make building full-stack apps in Node.js less painful. Over time, that small idea evolved into a framework that not only solved my problems but also resonated with developers worldwide.

## The Journey
AdonisJS has never been the "overnight success" kind of project. We don't have millions of stars on GitHub or big corporations funding us. But what we do have is far more meaningful: a **passionate**, **loving community**.

People who use AdonisJS tend to stick with it, and often tell me they can't imagine going back to anything else. That appreciation and belief in the framework is what has kept me going all these years.

Maintaining an open source framework for so long has also come with its challenges. There are always trade-offs to be made: balancing feature requests, keeping up with evolving tooling, and addressing support questions. And then there's the constant question of sustainability â€” how to keep improving the framework without burning out.

## What I'm Proud Of
One thing I take pride in is how **modern and debt-free** AdonisJS is today. We've avoided legacy baggage and outdated tooling, even when it meant painful rewrites. The result is a framework that feels up-to-date, consistent, and reliable.

## The Future
With 10 years behind us, I'm more excited about the future than ever.

I've committed to working **full-time on AdonisJS**, and part of that commitment is finding a way to sustain the project in the long run. Open source will always remain at the core, but commercialization will give us the resources to move faster and build the missing pieces that small teams need.

Here's how we're approaching it:

- **AdonisJS Insiders** â†’ A sponsorware program that helps sustain development. Insiders already have access to the AdonisJS v7 alpha, and it's the best way to support the project while getting early access. ðŸ‘‰ [insiders.adonisjs.com](https://insiders.adonisjs.com)

- **AdonisJS Plus** â†’ A one-time-purchase bundle of paid products designed to help developers build and ship faster. This is still in progress, and I will share more updates on it in the coming weeks.

## A Personal Note
I've always wanted AdonisJS to be a framework that helps individuals and small teams quickly turn their ideas into products. My role is to handle the low-level tooling, allowing you to focus on shipping features and growing your business.

Looking back, the past decade has been filled with ups and downs â€” moments of excitement, frustration, and everything in between. However, thanks to this passionate and loving community, the project has continued to move forward.

I'm grateful for everyone who has been part of the journey so far. And I'm excited for what's to come.
